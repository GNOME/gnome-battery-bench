NAME
----
gbb - Command line integration client for GNOME Battery Bench

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'gbb info [--json]'
'gbb monitor'
'gbb play <filename>'
'gbb play-local <filename>'
'gbb record' [-o | --output <output file]
'gbb test' [-o | --output <output file] [--duration <hours>h<minutes>m<seconds>s] [--min-battery <percent>] [--screen-brightness <percent>] [-v | --verbose] <test-id>

DESCRIPTION
------------

'gbb' is a command line client which is provided as part of the GNOME Battery Bench system.
For interactive exploration and testing, the GNOME Battery Bench application provides a
more polished interface, but gbb can be used for automating tests ('gbb tests'), developing
new tests ('gbb record', and 'gbb play'), and debugging the GNOME Battery Bench application code
('gbb monitor').

For more information about GNOME Battery Bench, see the GNOME Battery Bench

COMMANDS
--------

info
~~~~

'gbb info'

Display general hardware and software information. The information is not exhaustive,
focuses on power relevant components and is meant as a means to identify different
platforms and systems. If '--json' is specified then the output will be in the machine
readable JSON format; here unknown components will be omitted instead of reported as
"Unknown".

monitor
~~~~~~~

'gbb monitor'

Monitors the current battery usage and and prints statistics to standard out. This is
the same as 'gbb test --verbose' without actually running a test, and is mostly a tool
for debugging the GNOME Battery Bench application code.

play
~~~~

'gbb play' <filename>

Replays an event log recorded with 'gbb record'. This is mostly meant to try out an
event log that you recorded without having to create a full test and install it
the per-user or system-wide test directories.

play-local
~~~~~~~~~~

'gbb play-local' <filename>

Exactly the same as 'gbb play', but instead of talking to gnome-battery-bench-helper
over D-BUS, it assumes that the current user has privileges to simulate events
via '/dev/uinput'.

record
~~~~~~

'gbb record' [-o | --output <output file>]

Records events to standard output, or if '--output' is specified, to the given file.

test
~~~~

Runs the specified test. Tests are looked for in '/usr/share/gnome-battery-bench/tests'
and in '~/.config/gnome-battery-bench/.tests'.

'gbb test' [-o | --output <output file] [--duration <hours>h<minutes>m<seconds>s] [--min-battery <percent>] [--screen-brightness <percent>] <test-id>

--output;;
        Specifies the output filename. If not specified, the output will be written in
        '~/.local/share/gnome-batttery-bench/logs', and will be visible in the list of
        historical runs in the user interface.

--duration;;
        Specifies how long to run the test for. Any or all of hours, minutes, and seconds
        can be specified - e.g. '1h', '1h10m', '10m3s', '100s'.

--min-battery;;
        Specifies that the test will run until the battery reaches the specified percentage.
        Exclusive with the '--duration' argument

--screen-brightness;;
        Sets the brightness of the backlight during the test

--verbose;;
        Print verbose statistics in the style of 'gbb monitor'
